# Dinosaur-Game
As the final project of the course CS110 Computer Architectures, the Dinosaur-Game was built on a RISC-V Sipeed Longan Nano board and inspired by the Chrome Dinosaur Game.

@Yining She and I collaborated to finish it. The game was implemented by RISC-V and C programming languages. Our main source code are under the folder [p4_sheyn_wangshy3](https://github.com/wangsy503/Dinosaur-Game/tree/main/p4_sheyn_wangshy3), you are welcomed to read the `README.md` inside the folder to get more instructions on how to run it on a real machine.

Below is our demo video for this project.
